# Runbooks (templates)

These are minimal runbook templates for downstream repos. Customize them with your project details.

Suggested files:
- `lane2-deploy.md`
- `lane3-handoff.md`
- `lane5-govern.md`

Each runbook should reference:
- `docs/ops-lanes-agent.md`
- `docs/opsec-ops-lanes-signer-map.md`
