# Contributing

Thanks for improving the template.

## What we accept
- clearer runbook language
- better stop-conditions / guardrails
- improved schemas for intents/checks/approvals
- safer default `.gitignore` patterns
- examples that do **not** include real secrets

## What we do not accept
- anything that encourages pasting keys/seeds into repos or chats
- “convenience” changes that weaken lane separation or OPSEC boundaries
