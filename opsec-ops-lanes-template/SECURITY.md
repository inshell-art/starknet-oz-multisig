# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in this template (e.g., guidance that would cause unsafe behavior, or a file that could leak secrets), please open a private report or email the maintainer.

If you are using this template in production, treat any suspected leak as an incident:
- stop signing
- rotate HOT keys immediately
- review multisig signer safety
- audit any recent commits for secrets
